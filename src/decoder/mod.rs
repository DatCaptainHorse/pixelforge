//! Hardware-accelerated video decoding using Vulkan Video.
//!
//! The decoder consumes a coded byte stream and produces decoded frames as GPU
//! images (`vk::Image`), optionally with CPU readback. [`Decoder::decode`]
//! takes whatever the caller has: whole coded frames, if they arrive already
//! framed by a container or transport, or an arbitrary slice of a byte stream,
//! which the decoder frames itself using the codec's own rules (Annex B start
//! codes for H.264/H.265, OBU temporal units for AV1). See [`Framing`].
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! - **Asynchronous**: [`DecodeSink::decode`] records and submits without
//!   waiting for the GPU, so the CPU can parse and submit the next picture
//!   while the current one decodes. Frames arrive on the
//!   [`DecodeSource`] as they complete, and the two halves can be driven from
//!   separate threads. Mirrors
//!   [`Encoder::encode`](crate::encoder::Encoder::encode).
//! - **Stream-driven**: the Vulkan video session is created lazily from the
//!   stream's own parameter sets, so no dimensions or profile need to be
//!   configured up front. Mid-stream resolution changes recreate the session
//!   transparently.
//! - **Display order**: frames come out in presentation order; call
//!   [`DecodeSink::finish`] at end of stream to emit what reordering held back.
//!   Streams without B-frames buffer nothing and add no latency.
//! - **Zero-copy output**: where the device supports unified image layouts, a
//!   [`DecodedFrame`] is the decoder's own DPB image, held until the frame is
//!   dropped, and reordering holds images rather than copying pictures out.
//!   Elsewhere pictures are copied into private images instead. Either way the
//!   image is valid for exactly as long as the frame is; see [`DecodedFrame`]
//!   for what holding one costs.
//!
//! # Limitations (H.264)
//!
//! - Progressive streams only (no interlaced/field coding).
//! - Streams using explicit scaling matrices are rejected.
//!
//! Reference management is complete (IDR, sliding-window, and MMCO), so any
//! stream this crate's encoder produces — and typical output from x264, NVENC
//! and friends, including B-pyramid — decodes correctly.
